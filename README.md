## Description
Emissions inventories need to be prepared to be used in chemical transport models (CTMs). They usually need ad-hoc preprocessing based on the chemical mechanism used in the CTM, including speciation of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). 
Here we provide **monthly EDGAR v5.0 global  air  pollutant  emissions  for  the  year  2015,  speciated  for  the  MOZART  chemical  mechanism.** 
We also provide additional files to make it work in WRF-Chem [anthro-emiss preprocessing  tool](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem/wrf-chem-tools-community)  with the MOZART-MOSAIC options.

Emissions files are provided as individual NetCDF files for each pollutant containing anthropogenic sectors emissions in the following form:

These files are ready-to be used
